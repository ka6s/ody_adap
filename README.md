# Odyssey-II adapter
This is a break out board for the Oddyssey II HPSDR transceiver.

I have done a couple of versions of this - the final configuration has a SPI output, but also
expects to be able to support a x4 HERMES style filter set up.  There is also a custom 
connector on here to drive the companion antenna switch. Note that there is only ONE 
ANT output available - so only two antenna ports are supported.

Lots of copies of PTT-out..can't have too many of those!
